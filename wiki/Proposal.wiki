#summary Proposal due Oct. 8

== Problem or Idea ==
The problem description should be short and specific about the high-level goals of the project. It states what the problem is and why it is a problem or describes a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or work practice. It should also drop a hint at the proposed solution to the problem. 


== Analysis ==
The analysis section should give more background for the problem or new idea. It doesnâ€™t just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identifies some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or work practices should be used to support those claims. 


== Suggested Improvements ==
Here the proposal should propose specific changes to solve the problems or implement the new ideas described earlier and briefly explain why it is believed they will work.

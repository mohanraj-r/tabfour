Background

In this information age, managing information is more often a problem than collecting it. This problem of information overload is especially acute in the web domain. With more and more essential information going online and web pages turning into useful applications, users want it all to be more easily accessible. A lot of work has been done on making web sites more usable: we intend to take a critical look at the usability of the web browser. Have the various elements of web browsers, such as tabs, bookmarks and history, scaled sufficiently to deal with the complexities of the new age? To a user who has hundreds of bookmarked web pages, how useful or usable is the concept of bookmarks? Are tabs a good model for a user who routinely has more than 13 pages open [[1]]?

The strategy of reducing clutter using context and window management has evolved from single document interfaces through multiple document interfaces and currently to tabs. However, fueled by ever more powerful computers and the accelerating growth of the web, the number of concurrently open tabs seems to be steadily increasing for many users, and the current design of tabs in the browser often fails to handle the high level of ensuing complexity. In current web browsers, web pages are organized in tabs and windows. Users can open multiple windows and within each window a number of tabs. While tabs in various forms have been around for quite some time (mentioned by 1992, see [[3]]), tab-based web-browsing was introduced about a decade ago. Browser tabs were created to avoid cluttering the operating system's taskbar. However, it seems that the same problem has migrated to the browser's tab bar, resulting in unorganized and cluttered tabs. From past experiences of the users involved in our interview sessions, situations in which the users were overwhelmed by the number of tabs left open and unused in the browser is not uncommon. 

An increasing amount of effort can be witnessed in attempts to alleviate the problems of the tab interface. For e.g., in Internet Explorer 8, Microsoft introduced a way to help users to automatically organize the tabs using color based on their link relationships. A plethora of plugins exists for Firefox. The TabGroups [4] manager plugin for e.g., offers a similar yet more extensive solution in which the users can organize the tabs by groups.
 
While bookmarks and history give users access to the web pages that they have visited before, managing them can still be quite a daunting task especially when it comes to finding something specific one has in mind. Some users use bookmarks rarely if at all and rely on other mechanisms such as the auto-complete feature when typing in a URL, or entering the same string again in a search engine. Alternatively, some users create numerous bookmarks, but due to the complexity involved in managing them, end up using only a tiny percentage. Histories are uncategorized and typically listed only by site or according to chronological order, without context. Some work has been done to address this; for example there exist browser plugins such as History Tree for Firefox that present a spatial and hierarchical visualization of the browsing history. However, tools like these still don't make the browser transparent enough, suggesting that a more elegant solution is needed. 

Our system tackles the problem of browsing complexity by introducing an integrated, task-focused interface that reduces the tab, bookmark and history organization overhead altogether and makes browsing the web an easier task for the users.

Expected Types of Users

We expect our system to be used and beneficial to a large percentage of computer users who frequently browse through the Internet. However, due to limitation of time and to keep the evaluation within scope of the project, we narrow down our target user group to a subset of the population whom are expert browser users, meaning they regularly utilize a combination of organizational features in the web browser to aid their navigation of the Internet, including tabs, bookmarks and history.

Work Context

On a regular basis, users need to access the Internet to perform a variety of tasks, such as shopping, banking, browsing through medias and retrieving information in general. Not all these tasks can potentially lead to cluttered and unmanageable tabs and bookmarks; for example, we expect that highly exploratory tasks such as 'background research' or literature review will lead to heavier tab usage, while focused tasks such as online banking will not. We hope to focus on a combination of tasks/work context in user's browsing activities that require a heavier usage of the web browser's organizational features.

What the system will be used for

Our system is intended to be used for organizing tabs, bookmarks and histories when they would become unmanageable in the normal circumstances. The users can group tabs, bookmarks and histories together based on the tasks they are working on. Bookmark and history contents are generated on a per-task basis, and all contents associated with a task is cleared when the user finishes and deletes the task. We expect users would feel organizing browsing data in an explicit manner to be a tedious task at the beginning but progresses to realize the ease of use and the increase of productivity using our interface.

System Constraints

To simulate a real-world usage environment for our evaluation phase, we hope to implement our system as a plug-in for the Mozilla Firefox Browser. Our ability to tweak the browser interface might be somewhat limited; more research and exploration are needed to understand the capabilities of the Firefox plug-in development API. Our interface development is also subjected to time constraint, preventing us to properly evaluate the interface in normal daily usage over a longer period of time.
